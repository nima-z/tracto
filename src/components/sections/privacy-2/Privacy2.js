            A one-time customer-to-vendor payment is commonly used when you shop
            online at an e-commmerce site, such as Amazon. You click on the
            shopping cart icon, type in your credit card information and click
            on the checkout button. The site processes your credit card
            information and sends you an e-mail notifiying you that your payment
            was received. On some Web sites, you can use an e-check instead of a
            credit card. To pay by e-check, you type in your account number and
            your bank's routing number. The vendor authorizes payment through
            the customer's bank, which then either initiates an electronic funds
            transfer (EFT) or prints a check and mails it to the vendor. <br />{" "}

            through a regularly scheduled direct debit from your checking
